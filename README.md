##Clone the repo from last week

Last week we did a bunch of work on github, but this week we're going to do the
work locally on our own machines and then push the changes up to GitHub.

1. First we need to go back to last week's repo and "clone" it.
  https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/Learn-To-Code-Week-1
About half way down the page on the right hand underneath the settings tab you
should see text that says "SSH clone URL". Copy that URL and then head to your
terminal window.

2. Clone this repo locally
From the command line type ``` git clone PASTE-SSH-URL-HERE ```

3. Navigate to your newly cloned local repository
Once the cloning is complete you'll want to look for that project in your
current directory. You can do this by typing ```ls``` This should show you a
project called "Learn-To-Code-Week-1".

4. CD into that directory and open the project in Atom
Type ``` cd Learn-To-Code-Week-1 ``` into your terminal window. Once your in the
project type ```Atom . ``` This should open up this project in your Atom text
editor.
